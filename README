GETTING STARTED
===============

Updating/Installing boost source
--------------------------------

The boost source code is not included in this
git repository. Download a release tar ball
and unpack it in the root of the project.

For example,

$ wget https://dl.bintray.com/boostorg/release/1.68.0/source/boost_1_68_0.tar.bz2
$ tar xf boost_1_68_0.tar.bz2

Fix BOOST_VERSION and BOOST_SOURCE_DIR in build-cmd.sh if needed.

BUILDING
========

# To build the package:
cd 3p-boost
correct_autobuild_xml   # Replace zlib and openssl urls with the most current ones.
autobuild install	# Install zlib and openssl
autobuild build
autobuild package

The produced package is directly usable for Singularity and
does not need conversion.
